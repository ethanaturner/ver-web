# Ver for Web
The codebase for VerTV (aka Ver) on the web  
*(archived, service inactive)*


## About Ver
Ver (launched 2017) was a cross-platform application that allowed users to simply search a film or television title to find out which streaming services offered it. An account allowed users to customize Ver to match the streaming services they subscribed to. The app also allowed users to index their own DVD/Blu-ray collection and include it in the search results.  
Ver shutdown a short time after its launch when the previously open data provider privatized.

**Important**
This is the codebase for the public-facing VerTV web app. The original site template was provided by [FreeHTML5.co](https://freehtml5.co). Backend services were built using Google's Firebase. Several sensitive files for API connections have been removed. Any VerTV backend services are no longer active.
